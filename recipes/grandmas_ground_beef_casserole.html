        <h3>
            <li>
            Cook and Season the Ground Beef
        </h3>
            <p>Cook the beef in a skillet over medium-high heat until it's brown and crumbly.</p>
            <p>Drain and discard the grease. Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef and simmer until the flavors blend.</p>
            <p>Remove from heat and allow to cool.</p>
        </li>
        <h3>
            <li>
            Cook Egg Noodles
        </h3>
            <p>Boil the egg noodles until they're cooked through, but are still quite firm</p>
            <p>Drain in a colander and allow to cool slightly.</p>
        </li>
        <h3>
            <li>
            Mix Sour Cream and Cream Cheese
        </h3>
            <p>Mix the sour cream, cream cheese, and diced onion in a medium bowl until well-combined.</p>
        </li>
        <h3>
            <li>
            Assemble and Bake
        </h3>
            <p>Layer half of the egg noodles into a greased casserole dish.</p>
            <p>Top with half of the sour cream mixture, then half of the beef mixture.</p>
            <p>Repeat in the same order. Sprinkle the top layer of beef with cheese.</p>
            <p>Bake until the cheese is melted and golden, about 25-30 minutes.</p>
